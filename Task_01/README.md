# Titanic EDA and Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prediction model for the Titanic dataset. The main goal is to predict the survival of passengers based on various features like passenger class (Pclass), sex, title, group size (GrupSize), fare category (FareCat), and age category (AgeCat).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from [Kaggal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file). It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival.

## Files
- `tested.csv`: The training set.
- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for EDA and building the prediction model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for EDA and building the prediction model. 

## Results
The results of the EDA show that features like Pclass, sex, Title, GrupSize, FareCat, AgeCat have a significant impact on survival. The prediction model achieves an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set due to less amount of data.
